# Assignment 2
This assignment was completed in Year 2 as an elective module. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on models and constantly learning to train models and achieving greater sentiment and predictive analysis, translating into more accurate predictions of emotions and characters respectively for Part 1 and Part 2 of this assignment.
As much as I want to showcase my models here, it was ruined in a hard drive failure and was unfortunately unable to recover my work. However, please check out the report I've written for my full thought process and workings of this assignment.



# Assignment 2 Part 1 : Sentiment Analysis Model
This model aims to predict emotions from texts and displays an emoticon, indicating which emotion it predicts was being expressed in a phrase or sentence.
It did not take long for me to get my hands working on the base model, speeding my way through the project as I seriously enjoyed working with this and hearing my PC fans go into overdrive, desperately trying to cool the PC as it runs overnight.



# Assignment 2 Part 2 : Character Prediction Model
This part focuses more on character prediction, similar to Google predictive text. 
A sample text from Harry Potter was used to train the model to a decent accuracy before testing begun.
This assignent was slightly more challenging as the accuracy was only subpar in my opinion, but I persevered and ultimately obtained a decent accuracy.
